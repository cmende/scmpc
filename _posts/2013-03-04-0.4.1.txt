title: scmpc-0.4.1 has been released! And was moved!
---

This is just a bugfix release! See `NEWS` and `ChangeLog` for changes.
Note that this version now requires libmpdclient-2.3 (down from 2.4 in 0.4.0).
Also, since github no longer allows file hosting, the downloads were moved to
bitbucket and can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/cmende/scmpc/downloads
