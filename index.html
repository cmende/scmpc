    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><strong>scmpc</strong> is a client for <a href="http://www.musicpd.org">MPD</a> which submits your tracks to <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>.</p>
    <p>'<em>Another one?</em>', I hear you cry? Yes, I know about <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:Mpdscribble">mpdscribble</a>, but when I started this project it didn't do entirely what I wanted it to. It didn't run as a daemon, for example, and it didn't work if you enable crossfading in MPD. I didn't add the support for these in mpdscribble, partly because GNU coding style scares me, and I got slightly lost in the source code, but also because I created this as a way of teaching myself C programming.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be run as a daemon, either as a user or as root.</li>
      <li>Keeps unsubmitted songs in a queue which is saved to a file at a configurable interval.</li>
      <li>Will try to reconnect to MPD and Audioscrobbler if the network connection fails.</li>
      <li>Works with a password-protected MPD server.</li>
      <li>Works when crossfading is enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>scmpc-0.2.2 has been released!</strong><br/>This fixes a couple of bugs and adds a password_hash which accepts an md5-hash of your password for people who don't like their passwords to be in clear text in configs. Thanks to Bart Trojanowski for that feature!</p>
    <h4>May 29, 2006</h4>
    <p><strong>scmpc-0.2.1 has been released!</strong><br/>This is a bugfix and code cleanup release.</p>
    <h4>March 24, 2006</h4>
    <p><strong>scmpc-0.2.0 has been released!</strong><br/>scmpc has been more-or-less completely rewritten for this version. It corrects all sorts of bugs, and makes the program behave more sensibly all round. No new features though, since I don't know what features anyone else wants...</p>
    <h4>March 13, 2006</h4>
    <p><strong>scmpc-0.1.1 has been released!</strong><br/>This contains some bugfixes, and should hopefully fix the problems with files getting created with 000 permissions.</p>
